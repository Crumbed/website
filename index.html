                    <p>
                        A CLI-based calculator for solving general equations supporting:
                        functions, variables, exponents, implicit multiplication, 
                        & general math operations. Implementation is very similar 
                        to a programming language interpreter, like python or lua,
                        using a lexer to tokenize input, which is fed into an AST 
                        parser, and finally interpreted to output equation results.

                        A Minecraft server plugin that vastly changes the core

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately the teacher this was made for didnt have
                        the time to help me test this using a teacher account so
                        I have no clue if this works as intended. However, its 
                        supposed to make calls to the Canvas API (the service my school 
                        used for online assignments) to get recently graded submissions.
                        Then, if a submission was given a failing grade it would
                        get that students contact info using the Google Sheets API
                        and email said student, notifying them of the their failing 
                        grade and sending them a document containing assignment 
                        makeup & retake information. After all that it would then 
                        update another spreadsheet containing logs of every automated
                        contact that was made. This project was fun because I had 
                        to figure out how the poorly documented Canvas API worked
                        and use other Google APIs to solve a real world problem.

                    <a href="https://www.github.com/Crumbed/lehman_automation">[Github link] I have no documentation for how this works because I had no way of knowing if it DID work</a>

                    <h3>Wordle Solver: Algorithm for solving the daily Wordle (Python)</h3>
                    <p>
                        When Wordle blew up in popularity I realised that I was 
                        very bad at it, so I wanted to make an program to solve
                        Wordle faster and in fewer guesses than my friends.
                        At the time you could get the list of all the possible
                        Wordle solutions via inspect element, this was the core
                        of my program. Using the list of solutions, I generated
                        a dataset ranking how common every first, last, &
                        combination of 2 letters assigning them a "weight". 
                        Then I simply used user input of g(reen), y(ellow), or b(lack) 
                        for each letter of the generated guess to filter out possible 
                        solutions, and ranking the remaining solutions based on
                        the generated dataset. In the end I made a program that
                        not only solved Wordle faster than a human, but also in 
                        less guesses on average. I submitted this project for my
                        computer science final and got a 100% and a nice note from
                        my teacher.
